# La Biblioteca Eterna

A meditative roguelike experience set within a vast, ever-shifting metaphysical library. Players embark on a journey of self-discovery and understanding through the accumulated knowledge of humanity.

## Overview

La Biblioteca Eterna is a unique roguelike that departs from the genre's typical emphasis on combat and high-stakes challenges. Instead, it offers a contemplative experience where players, as "almas perdidas" (lost souls), explore an infinite library existing between life and death.

The game features:
- Sophisticated multi-agent LLM architecture for dynamic narrative and NPC interactions
- Procedurally generated library environments with Spanish Catholic architectural influences
- A deep knowledge system where discoveries persist across playthroughs
- High-performance ASCII rendering optimized for modern displays
- Meditative gameplay focused on exploration and understanding
