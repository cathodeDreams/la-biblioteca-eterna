# 2. Fine-tuning Techniques

There are several approaches to fine-tuning LLMs, each with its own trade-offs in terms of computational cost, performance, and memory requirements.

## Full Fine-tuning

*   **Description:**  This is the most straightforward approach.  You update *all* the parameters of the pre-trained model during the fine-tuning process.
*   **Pros:**  Potentially achieves the best performance, as the entire model is adapted to the new task.
*   **Cons:**  Computationally expensive and requires significant memory, especially for large models.  Can lead to overfitting if the dataset is small.

## Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)

PEFT methods aim to reduce the computational cost and memory requirements of fine-tuning by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters.

### LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

*   **Description:**  LoRA freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable *low-rank* matrices into specific layers (typically the attention layers). These low-rank matrices are much smaller than the original weight matrices, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.
*   **Pros:**  Much more efficient than full fine-tuning, both in terms of computation and memory.  Often achieves comparable performance to full fine-tuning.
*   **Cons:**  Requires careful selection of the rank and the layers to which LoRA is applied.
*   **How it works:** Imagine a large matrix representing a layer's weights. LoRA decomposes this matrix into two smaller matrices (A and B).  During fine-tuning, only A and B are updated. The output is calculated as: `Original_Weights * Input + (A * B) * Input`.

### QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)

*   **Description:**  An extension of LoRA that further reduces memory usage by quantizing the pre-trained model weights to lower precision (e.g., 4-bit).
*   **Pros:**  Extremely memory-efficient, allowing fine-tuning of very large models on consumer-grade hardware.
*   **Cons:**  Quantization can sometimes lead to a slight decrease in performance. Requires careful calibration.

### Adapters

*   **Description:**  Small, task-specific modules inserted between the layers of the pre-trained model.  Only the adapter modules are trained during fine-tuning.
*   **Pros:**  Efficient and modular.  Allows for easy switching between different tasks by swapping adapters.
*   **Cons:**  May not be as effective as LoRA for some tasks.

### Prefix Tuning

*   **Description:**  Adds a small number of trainable parameters (the "prefix") to the input embedding of the model.  Only the prefix is updated during fine-tuning.
*   **Pros:**  Very parameter-efficient.
*   **Cons:**  Can be less effective than other PEFT methods for complex tasks.

## Knowledge Distillation

*   **Description:**  A technique where a smaller "student" model is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger "teacher" model. This is particularly useful for compressing large models into smaller, more efficient ones.
*   **Teacher-Student Models:** The teacher model is typically a large, pre-trained LLM. The student model is a smaller model that is trained to reproduce the teacher's output.
*   **Distillation Objectives:**  The student model is trained to minimize the difference between its output and the teacher's output. This can be done using various loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss or KL divergence.
*   **Data Considerations:**  Knowledge distillation can be performed with or without the original training data.  Using the original data can improve performance, but it's not always necessary.

**Choosing the Right Technique:**

For La Biblioteca Eterna, a combination of techniques will likely be the best approach:

*   **Director LLM:**  QLoRA or LoRA, due to the model's size (8B parameters).
*   **NPC Agents:** LoRA or Adapters, as these models are smaller (≤1B parameters).
*   **Book LLMs:**  Knowledge distillation to create very small, specialized models (≤100M parameters) from larger, pre-trained models.  Potentially LoRA for "special" books.

This strategy balances performance, efficiency, and memory usage across the different LLM roles in the game.
