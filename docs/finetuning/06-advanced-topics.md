# 6. Advanced Topics

## Catastrophic Forgetting

*   **Problem:**  When fine-tuning an LLM, it can sometimes "forget" what it learned during pre-training. This is especially problematic if the fine-tuning dataset is very different from the pre-training data.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Lower Learning Rates:** Use a smaller learning rate to avoid drastic changes to the model's weights.
    *   **Regularization:**  Techniques like weight decay or dropout can help prevent overfitting and catastrophic forgetting.
    *   **Rehearsal:**  Include some data from the pre-training distribution in the fine-tuning dataset.
    *   **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC):**  A more advanced technique that penalizes changes to weights that are important for the pre-trained task.

## Overfitting and Regularization

*   **Overfitting:**  When the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data.
*   **Regularization Techniques:**
    *   **Weight Decay:**  Adds a penalty to the loss function that discourages large weights.
    *   **Dropout:**  Randomly drops out neurons during training, forcing the model to learn more robust features.
    *   **Data Augmentation:**  Increases the diversity of the training data, making the model less likely to overfit.
    *   **Early Stopping:**  Stop training when the performance on the validation set starts to decrease.

## Hyperparameter Optimization

*   **Problem:**  Finding the optimal values for hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) can be challenging.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Grid Search:**  Try all possible combinations of hyperparameter values within a specified range.
    *   **Random Search:**  Randomly sample hyperparameter values from a specified distribution.
    *   **Bayesian Optimization:**  A more sophisticated technique that uses a probabilistic model to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters.
    *   **Tools:**  Optuna, Ray Tune.

## Distributed Training

*   **Problem:**  Fine-tuning large models can be very time-consuming.
*   **Solution:**  Distribute the training process across multiple GPUs or even multiple machines.
*   **Tools:**  PyTorch Lightning, DeepSpeed, Horovod.

## Continual Learning

*   **Problem:**  How to update the model with new information without retraining from scratch.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Rehearsal:**  Store a small amount of data from previous tasks and include it in the training data for new tasks.
    *   **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC):**  Penalize changes to weights that are important for previous tasks.
    *   **Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM):**  A more advanced technique that uses a memory buffer to store gradients from previous tasks.

For La Biblioteca Eterna, these advanced topics are important considerations:

*   **Catastrophic Forgetting:**  We need to ensure that the Director LLM doesn't lose its general language capabilities when fine-tuned on the game's narrative.
*   **Overfitting:**  We need to avoid overfitting to the specific training data, especially for the NPC and Book LLMs.
*   **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  We'll need to carefully tune the hyperparameters for each model to achieve optimal performance.
*   **Distributed Training:**  This will likely be necessary for fine-tuning the Director LLM (8B parameters).
*   **Continual Learning:**  This could be useful for updating the models with new content or player feedback over time.
