# La Biblioteca Eterna: Design Document

## Overview

La Biblioteca Eterna is conceived as a meditative roguelike experience, a departure from the genre's typical emphasis on combat and high-stakes challenges.  It is set within a vast, ever-shifting library, a metaphysical space existing between the realms of life and death. Players inhabit the role of an "alma perdida" – a lost soul – embarking on a journey of self-discovery and understanding through the accumulated knowledge of humanity, housed within the library's infinite shelves. The core gameplay loop emphasizes exploration, the uncovering of hidden knowledge, and quiet contemplation, fostering a sense of intellectual and spiritual growth.

## Game Design

### Core Experience

The central pillar of La Biblioteca Eterna's design is the exploration of profound themes: consciousness, the nature of knowledge, and the meaning of existence itself. The player's journey is not merely a physical traversal of the library's spaces, but a simultaneous spiritual and intellectual pilgrimage. Every interaction within the library – whether it's deciphering the text of an ancient book, engaging in conversation with another lost soul, or simply contemplating the environment – holds the potential to grant *revelaciones*. These revelaciones are profound insights, moments of clarity that transcend individual playthroughs. They persist, accumulating and evolving, shaping the player's understanding of their purpose within the library and the wider metaphysical context.

The library itself is envisioned as a character, a living entity. Its architecture is heavily inspired by Spanish Catholic design principles, drawing from the aesthetics of monastery libraries, the soaring grandeur of Gothic cathedrals, and the intricate geometric patterns found in Islamic-influenced architecture. This creates an environment that feels simultaneously sacred, scholarly, and imbued with a sense of timeless mystery. The library dynamically responds to the player's presence, utilizing sophisticated lighting and sound design. Shadows cast by towering bookshelves shift and dance, while the gentle flicker of candlelight and the subtle sounds of the ancient structure create an atmosphere of contemplative solitude, encouraging introspection and a deeper connection with the game world.

### Narrative Architecture

Traditional, linear narrative structures are deliberately avoided. Instead, La Biblioteca Eterna employs an emergent storytelling system powered by a sophisticated, multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) architecture. Each non-player character (NPC) encountered within the library is not a simple automaton, but a fully realized consciousness. Each NPC is driven by its own individual LLM instance, granting it the capacity to form memories, develop relationships (both with the player and other NPCs), and engage in complex, nuanced dialogues.

These individual interactions are carefully orchestrated by a higher-level "Director" LLM. The Director acts as a narrative conductor, maintaining overall coherence and ensuring that individual encounters contribute to the broader themes of the experience. The Director evaluates the significance of events as they unfold, intelligently prunes and distributes memories among the various agent LLMs, and subtly guides the narrative flow to create a meaningful and personalized journey for each player.

### Progression Systems

Progression in La Biblioteca Eterna deviates significantly from traditional roguelike metrics. There are no experience points, levels, or combat statistics. Instead, progress is measured by the accumulation of *revelaciones* – those profound insights gained through reading, conversation, and quiet contemplation. These insights are not merely ephemeral; they persist across multiple playthroughs, gradually unlocking new areas of the library, enabling deeper and more meaningful conversations with NPCs, and granting access to increasingly esoteric and profound knowledge.

The game's progression is intentionally non-linear and highly personalized. Two players might read the same book or engage in the same conversation, yet glean entirely different insights based on their prior experiences and accumulated revelaciones. This leads to unique and divergent paths through the library's vast collection of knowledge and its ever-shifting architecture. This emergent progression system is designed to create a deeply personal and meaningful journey of discovery for each individual player, fostering a sense of ownership and unique connection with their experience.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Systems

The technical foundation of La Biblioteca Eterna is a hierarchical LLM architecture, meticulously designed for efficient runtime performance and seamless integration with the game engine. The system utilizes a primary Director LLM (with approximately 8 billion parameters) for high-level game management and narrative orchestration, while a constellation of smaller, specialized models handles specific interactions, content generation, and individual agent behaviors.
