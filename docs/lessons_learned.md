# Lessons Learned from Mediterranean Wanderer Development

This document summarizes key lessons learned during the development of "Mediterranean Wanderer," as documented in the `technical_report.md`. These lessons are broadly applicable to game development, particularly projects involving procedural generation, roguelike mechanics, and Python.

## 1. The Importance of Iterative Development and TDD

The `technical_report.md` clearly demonstrates the value of an iterative development process, tightly coupled with Test-Driven Development (TDD).  The chronological history shows numerous cycles of:

*   **Proposing a feature/change.**
*   **Implementing the feature.**
*   **Writing tests.**
*   **Running tests (pytest) and type checking (mypy).**
*   **Refactoring and fixing issues identified by tests and type checking.**
*   **Repeating the cycle.**

This iterative approach allowed for:

*   **Early detection of bugs:** Problems were caught and fixed quickly, preventing them from becoming larger, more complex issues later.
*   **Continuous improvement:** The code was constantly refined and improved based on feedback from tests and type checking.
*   **Increased confidence:** The extensive test suite provided confidence that changes didn't introduce regressions.
*   **Better code quality:** The combination of TDD, type hints, and code formatting tools (black, isort) resulted in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

**Lesson:** Embrace iterative development and TDD from the start.  Write tests *before* implementing features, and use tests and type checking as a continuous feedback loop.

## 2. Mastering the Tools: libtcod, pytest, mypy, SpecStory

The project demonstrates a growing mastery of the core tools:

*   **libtcod:** The developer became proficient in using libtcod for console manipulation, rendering, event handling, and procedural generation (noise).  The progression from basic rendering to complex terrain visualization and UI elements shows this growth.  Deprecation warnings were addressed promptly, demonstrating an understanding of the library's evolution.
*   **pytest:** The extensive use of `pytest`, including parametrized tests, fixtures, and mocking, shows a strong understanding of testing best practices.  The tests are well-organized and cover a wide range of functionality.
*   **mypy:** The consistent use of `mypy` for static type checking helped to identify and prevent type-related errors.  The developer actively addressed `mypy` errors, improving the code's robustness and maintainability.
*   **SpecStory:** The use of SpecStory ([https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory)), a VSCode extension for the Cursor IDE, highlights the value of capturing and learning from AI coding journeys.  It automatically saves Cursor chat and composer sessions, aiding in documentation and reflection.

**Lesson:** Invest time in learning your tools thoroughly.  Understand their capabilities and best practices.  Use them consistently to improve code quality, prevent errors, and document your AI-assisted development process.

## 3. The Value of Detailed Documentation

The `technical_report.md` itself is a testament to the value of detailed documentation.  The chronological history of development steps, including file references, actions taken, changes made, and commands used, is invaluable for:

*   **Tracking progress:** It provides a clear record of what has been done and when.
*   **Understanding the codebase:** It explains the *why* behind design decisions and code changes.
*   **Debugging:** It helps to pinpoint the source of issues by tracing them back to specific changes.
*   **Onboarding new developers:** It would make it much easier for someone else to understand and contribute to the project.

**Lesson:** Maintain detailed documentation throughout the development process.  Record not just *what* was done, but also *why* it was done. Tools like SpecStory can assist in documenting AI-assisted development.

## 4. Handling Deprecations and API Changes

The project encountered and addressed deprecation warnings from libtcod (e.g., `tcod.context.new_terminal`, `tcod.event.KeySym`, `tcod.LEFT`). This demonstrates the importance of:

*   **Staying up-to-date:** Being aware of changes in the libraries you're using.
*   **Addressing warnings promptly:** Don't ignore deprecation warnings; they indicate that code will break in future versions.
*   **Testing after updates:** Ensure that changes to address deprecations don't introduce regressions.

**Lesson:** Regularly update your dependencies and address any deprecation warnings or API changes.  Thorough testing is crucial after making these updates.

## 5. Importance of UI/UX Considerations

The project demonstrates a growing awareness of UI/UX principles.  Early versions had basic rendering and input handling, but later iterations focused on:

*   **Frame-based layout:** Creating a more organized and visually appealing UI.
*   **Message wrapping:** Handling long messages gracefully.
*   **Message overflow:** Preventing messages from overflowing the UI.
*   **Input responsiveness:** Switching from blocking to non-blocking input handling.
*   **Resizable window support:** Adapting to different window sizes.

**Lesson:** Pay attention to UI/UX from the beginning.  Even in a text-based game, a well-designed UI can significantly improve the player experience.

## 6. Troubleshooting and Problem-Solving

The `technical_report.md` documents several instances of troubleshooting, including:

*   **`FileNotFoundError` and `RuntimeError`:** These were resolved by correctly resolving asset paths and managing the `tcod.context` properly.
*   **Type errors:** These were identified and fixed using `mypy`.
*   **Test failures:** These were addressed by iteratively refining the code and tests.
*   **Logic errors:** These were identified and corrected through careful debugging and testing.

**Lesson:** Develop strong problem-solving skills.  Use debugging tools, logging, and testing to identify and fix issues.  Don't be afraid to experiment and iterate.

## 7. Planning and Design

While the iterative development was effective, the technical report also highlights the importance of initial planning. The existence of a `game-design.md` file, even if not perfectly followed, provided a roadmap and overall vision for the project. This helped to guide development and prevent aimless wandering.

**Lesson:** Have a clear design document, even if it evolves over time. This provides a framework for development and helps to ensure that the project stays on track.

## 8. Version Control (Git)

Version control, using a system like Git, is essential for any software project. It enables:

*   **Tracking changes:** Seeing the history of modifications.
*   **Reverting to previous versions:** Undoing mistakes.
*   **Collaboration:** Working with others on the same codebase.

**Lesson:** Use version control (e.g., Git) from the very beginning of any project.

These lessons, gleaned from the "Mediterranean Wanderer" development process, provide valuable insights for future projects, including "La Biblioteca Eterna." They emphasize the importance of iterative development, TDD, thorough documentation, tool mastery, UI/UX considerations, problem-solving skills, and planning.
